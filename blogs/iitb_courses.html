                Inspired from <a href="https://theshadow29.github.io/AI-Course-Selection-IITB/" target="_blank" alt="blog"> this </a>
                and <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2018/03/30/guide-to-Artificial-Intelligence-Stanford.html" target="_blank" alt="blog"> this </a>post, 
                I am sharing my views and materials that were generated by taking some of the courses, here at IIT Bombay, for my future reference. 
                The materials that I am sharing here are generally my own intellectual property, like course presentations, 
                reports etc. This is an ongoing blog and will be updated at the end of each semester. To be honest there are no 
                such AI/ML tracks here at IIT Bombay, but one can make according to their requirements. I am enrolled here as a 
                PhD in C-MInDS department, and for some obvious obligatory reasons, I need to do an AI/ML track which was curated 
                by my supervisor, since he is the best in recommending courses. <br><br>

                <h4 id="bold_id">Deep Learning - Theory and Practice (IE-643) </h4><br>

                This is from the IEOR department, and one of my favorite courses taught by P. Balamurugan. The depth and breadth covered in this course 
                is just amazing, exactly what is needed by a student. There are no such requirements for this course, except one 
                needs to be comfortable with Python3 and should have some knowledge of machine learning and Pytorch. When I joined 
                the course, I didn't have any experience of Pytorch, since I used to do everything in either Tensorflow or Keras, 
                but I picked it along the way. This might be a bit difficult to those folks who don't like math and extensive coding, 
                but DL/ML is all about coding, math and creating new technology. So, if you are really into Deep Learning and need 
                to take a course, I will surely recommend this one. <br> <br>

                Another good thing about this course is, this course does not have an end-semester exam, but one needs to do a 
                good project to finish the course requirement. To be honest, this form of teaching is necessary, since there is 
                nothing to gain from rote learning. When creating new technology, one should know the concepts, not memorize 
                formulas and solve sums. This course is open book too, and the questions are a bit difficult, if you don't 
                prepare regularly.  <br> <br>

                So, for me I had to do a <a href="../blogs/IITB_Courses/IE643/Zero1_IE643_CourseProject_Prep.pdf" target="_blank" alt="pre-mid-term"> pre-mid-sem presentation </a>, 
                a <a href="../blogs/IITB_Courses/IE643/Zero1_IE643_CourseProject_MidtermReview.pdf" target="_blank" alt="post-mid-term"> post mid-sem presentation </a> an 
                <a href="../blogs/IITB_Courses/IE643/Zero1_IE643_CourseProject_EndtermReview.pdf" target="_blank" alt="end-term"> end-sem presentation </a> along with the
                <a href="../blogs/IITB_Courses/IE643/Zero1_IE643_CourseProject_EndtermReview_EndTermReport.pdf" target="_blank" alt="end-term"> report </a> of 
                an interesting project which fetched me an AP grade. I did learn a lot from this course, and we also coded some stuff from scratch, and wrote 
                a <a href="../blogs/IITB_Courses/IE643/IE643_22D1594_CHALLENGE_REPORT.pdf" target="_blank" alt="challenge report">report on detecting camouflaged objects</a>. 
                The assignments were challenging and very relevant to the coursework, 
                which challenges you to do things differently. <br> <br>


                <h4 id="bold_id">  Foundations of Machine Learning (CS-725) </h4><br>

                This course is a necessity, in case you are willing to take the Advanced Machine Learning course. 
                This course is taught by Preethi Jyothi. The materials offered in this course are lucid and this also 
                has an open book exam. If you are taking this course, you have to take one quiz, mid-sem exam, end-sem 
                exam and one project, which can be done in a team of 3 to 5. There is flexibility and one can choose any 
                topic one wishes to explore in the future. We had some tough assignments, 
                and it took a whole week to find the best hyper-parameters. I really learned a lot, since I never expected that we need to put so much 
                effort on just hyper-parameter tuning when building things from scratch, which the normal libraries takes care of internally. 
                For the project, the main team members who contributed were Prateek Chanda (ex Microsoft Research) and Sandarbh Yadav (ex Oracle). 
                I could have contributed much in this project, but I had some other stuff too, hence 
                teamwork paid off. We made the best  <a href="../blogs/IITB_Courses/CS725/report.pdf" target="_blank" alt="report cs-725">report </a>and 
                <a href="../blogs/IITB_Courses/CS725/presentation.pdf" target="_blank" alt="presentation">presentation</a> for this course. <br> <br>

                This course covers the foundations of machine learning. If you are into core-statistical-ml you can take this course. 
                Deep leaning folks need to take this course, since this covers some basic foundations which will be required by other 
                advanced courses. Don't expect the exams to be easy, just because it is open-book, it is the reverse here in IIT Bombay, 
                all the courses have unique question papers, which are created from previous iteration of the courses, and will compel 
                you to think naturally even with all the materials in hand.
