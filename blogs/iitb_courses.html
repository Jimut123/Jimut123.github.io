                Inspired from <a href="https://theshadow29.github.io/AI-Course-Selection-IITB/" target="_blank" alt="blog"> this </a>
                and <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2018/03/30/guide-to-Artificial-Intelligence-Stanford.html" target="_blank" alt="blog"> this </a>post, 
                I am sharing my views and materials that were generated by taking some of the courses, here at IIT Bombay, for my future reference. 
                The materials that I am sharing here are generally my own intellectual property, like course presentations, 
                reports etc. This is an ongoing blog and will be updated at the end of each semester. To be honest there are no 
                such AI/ML tracks here at IIT Bombay, but one can make according to their requirements. I am enrolled here as a 
                PhD in C-MInDS department, and for some obvious obligatory reasons, I need to do an AI/ML track which was curated 
                by my supervisor, since he is the best in recommending courses. <br><br>

                <h4 id="bold_id">Deep Learning - Theory and Practice (IE-643) </h4><br>

                This is from the IEOR department, and one of my favorite courses taught by P. Balamurugan. The depth and breadth covered in this course 
                is just amazing, exactly what is needed by a student. There are no such requirements for this course, except one 
                needs to be comfortable with Python3 and should have some knowledge of machine learning and Pytorch. When I joined 
                the course, I didn't have any experience of Pytorch, since I used to do everything in either Tensorflow or Keras, 
                but I picked it along the way. This might be a bit difficult to those folks who don't like math and extensive coding, 
                but DL/ML is all about coding, math and creating new technology. So, if you are really into Deep Learning and need 
                to take a course, I will surely recommend this one. <br> <br>

                Another good thing about this course is, this course does not have an end-semester exam, but one needs to do a 
                good project to finish the course requirement. To be honest, this form of teaching is necessary, since there is 
                nothing to gain from rote learning. When creating new technology, one should know the concepts, not memorize 
                formulas and solve sums. This course is open book too, and the questions are a bit difficult, if you don't 
                prepare regularly.  <br> <br>

                So, for me I had to do a <a href="../blogs/IITB_Courses/IE643/Zero1_IE643_CourseProject_Prep.pdf" target="_blank" alt="pre-mid-term"> pre-mid-sem presentation </a>, 
                a <a href="../blogs/IITB_Courses/IE643/Zero1_IE643_CourseProject_MidtermReview.pdf" target="_blank" alt="post-mid-term"> post mid-sem presentation </a> an 
                <a href="../blogs/IITB_Courses/IE643/Zero1_IE643_CourseProject_EndtermReview.pdf" target="_blank" alt="end-term"> end-sem presentation </a> along with the
                <a href="../blogs/IITB_Courses/IE643/Zero1_IE643_CourseProject_EndtermReview_EndTermReport.pdf" target="_blank" alt="end-term"> report </a> of 
                an interesting project which fetched me an AP grade. I did learn a lot from this course, and we also coded some stuff from scratch, and wrote 
                a <a href="../blogs/IITB_Courses/IE643/IE643_22D1594_CHALLENGE_REPORT.pdf" target="_blank" alt="challenge report">report on detecting camouflaged objects</a>. 
                The assignments were challenging and very relevant to the coursework, 
                which challenges you to do things differently. <br> <br>


                <h4 id="bold_id">  Foundations of Machine Learning (CS-725) </h4><br>

                This course is a necessity, in case you are willing to take the Advanced Machine Learning course. 
                This course is taught by Preethi Jyothi. The materials offered in this course are lucid and this also 
                has an open book exam. If you are taking this course, you have to take one quiz, mid-sem exam, end-sem 
                exam and one project, which can be done in a team of 3 to 5. There is flexibility and one can choose any 
                topic one wishes to explore in the future. We had some tough assignments, 
                and it took a whole week to find the best hyper-parameters. I really learned a lot, since I never expected that we need to put so much 
                effort on just hyper-parameter tuning when building things from scratch, which the normal libraries takes care of internally. 
                For the project, the main team members who contributed were Prateek Chanda (ex Microsoft Research) and Sandarbh Yadav (ex Oracle). 
                I could have contributed much in this project, but I had some other stuff too, hence 
                teamwork paid off. We made the best  <a href="../blogs/IITB_Courses/CS725/report.pdf" target="_blank" alt="report cs-725">report </a>and 
                <a href="../blogs/IITB_Courses/CS725/presentation.pdf" target="_blank" alt="presentation">presentation</a> for this course. <br> <br>

                This course covers the foundations of machine learning. If you are into core-statistical-ml you can take this course. 
                Deep leaning folks need to take this course, since this covers some basic foundations which will be required by other 
                advanced courses. Don't expect the exams to be easy, just because it is open-book, it is the reverse here in IIT Bombay, 
                all the courses have unique question papers, which are created from previous iteration of the courses, and will compel 
                you to think naturally even with all the materials in hand.  <br> <br>


                <h4 id="bold_id"> Communication Skills (DS-899) </h4><br>

                This might look like one of the redundant courses at first glance (for it being a P/NP course), 
                but this is a gem. At least respect the fact that the best profs in India are giving their 
                precious time for this course for you, which they could actually utilize in their research. We had all 
                the good faculties from each of the departments come, pitch, and assign homework. Yeah, the homework 
                might be a bit tiring if you have other commitments like RnD and difficult courses since each of 
                the assignments takes a minimum of 5 hours of commitment. We did learn a lot of different perspectives 
                which trained us to become better and more skillful academicians. The course is well structured, and 
                expect one assignment every week. Don't miss the classes since attendance is mandatory here.
                Here are some of the materials generated from this course:<br><br>

                <h4 id="bold_id"> Advanced Machine Learning (CS-726) </h4><br>


                The course is taught by Prof. Sunita Sarawagi. The way she relates the explainable 
                and classic Probabilistic Graphical Models with Deep Learning is just on a different 
                level. This is one of a kind course specifically designed for those students who want 
                to pursue research in Machine Learning and the advanced concepts of Deep Learning. 
                Though this is a conceptually loaded course, one might want to learn these concepts 
                again, even after the course ends. I liked the part where we were taught about 
                Generative Networks, where there were several variants of it, and I would like to 
                revisit the material once again from time to time. I think it is entirely okay not 
                to do good in this course since stuff from the last 50 years is taught in a 4 months 
                period, but I would definitely recommend this course once you have made up your mind 
                to do research in core Machine Learning. Another piece of advice would be to start the 
                project from the beginning, which we didn't (I would also like to genuinely thank my 
                team members for saving me); we procrastinated till the last date due 
                to various reasons and made the report and presentation the day before the submission. 
                Here is a sample of the

                This course is taught by none other than my own advisor, Prof. Suyash P. Awate.

                ([<a href="https://dampeeiitb.wordpress.com/cs-736-algorithms-for-medical-image-processing/" target="_blank" alt="link1">link1</a>] 
                and [<a href="https://theshadow29.github.io/AI-Course-Selection-IITB/" target="_blank" alt="link1">link2</a>])
                have better reviews of the course. I highly recommend taking this course since this is one of a kind. 
                There are a lot of evergreen classic Machine Learning topics that are essential for 
                practicing theoretical and applied DL, which are thoroughly taught here. The only 
                piece of advice I would like to give is to practice the materials regularly, rather 
                than cramming up for 2 days before the exam. Things really go blank if you cram up 
                before the night, this is a mathematically loaded course, so pay attention to detail, 
                and don't neglect even a single line from the slide. 
                If this is the first time you are learning about topics related to 
                statistics and algorithms, then this course will be very difficult for you. 
                Make sure you have the required prerequisites for the course. Also, all the good 
                students (senior year BTechs from all the departments) take this course (they already 
                have a fair understanding of all the topics covered in this course) hence the competition 
                is really tough for this course (at least for me). Make very short notes and make 
                sure you are able to re-create the fundamental knowledge of topics depicted in the 
                slides exactly, using those notes.
