                What exactly causes dreams? I am referring to Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep,
                not ambitions. There are various types of dreams â€“ dreams that arise from stress 
                (hopefully just a few weeks before exams), dreams that arise from PTSD (Post 
                Traumatic Stress Disorder), lucid dreams, precognitive dreams, dreams that 
                let you lose track of time, haunted dreams, and last but not the least 
                dreams that cause sleeping paralysis. My first memorable dream was probably 
                in class 1, and I was discussing this with my cousins; some had dreams they 
                didnâ€™t remember, and some didnâ€™t even have any dreams. <br><br>

                Over the last few years, my dreams have become clearer. Not only 
                can I concoct a thrilling story from some of my dreams, but sometimes 
                I feel if I can think of so many inter-connected dependent events in my 
                subconsciousness, what would happen if I was able to use 100% of my cognition? 
                Unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_percent_of_the_brain_myth" target="_blank">
                we only use around 35% of our conscious memory at a given stage </a>. 
                Our mind only remembers stuff that it finds necessary to remember; I have no 
                control over this phenomenon of remembering things at will. I find it very 
                difficult to mug up stuff, and I envy those who can memorize stuff at will. 
                Our way of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo" target="_blank">
                perceiving things is different. </a> <br><br>

                The most common dreams that have been reported across the world are semi-haunted 
                and stressful. I have experienced all sorts of dreams, even precognition. The most 
                common of my dreams has been my failure to reach school on time, but I rarely missed 
                school in real life, maybe two times in a lifetime. The second most common one is I 
                am having an exam, especially some English or Hindi exam, the next day, and I have 
                to read and remember what each of the characters did, along with their name, and 
                probably their credit card numbers too (?) I mean, who does that? This was probably 
                because of the severe punishment (we come from a generation when beating by teachers 
                was legally allowed) for missing unnecessary details of a useless chapter that doesnâ€™t 
                have value, just redundant facts to be memorized and vomited in exams. Even anime have 
                more thrilling stories that give you life lessons. This is simple PTSD. <br><br>

                The same school gives me lucid memories more often than others. I have a nap, 
                and in two hours, I have lived so much (maybe a full day of any class chosen 
                randomly between 6 to 11). Memories are deceiving; what is concrete are facts. 
                I didn't like school that much until I left it. Those subtle memories of me 
                returning home with my pals, going to coaching, and discussing life on the way 
                home have been etched in my soul. I have some of the best friends from school 
                whom I still cherish to date. Iâ€™m not sure why the dream comes in a particular 
                dark-tint color (of evening hue), maybe because I donâ€™t remember much about my 
                past, and things are projected in a different dimension, making these common 
                dreams very lucid. Every time I sleep, I wish I had dreams that kept me in the 
                past when things were so-called simple, my favorite school days. These dreams 
                clear my mind and give me a direction to think positively. So, timelines in 
                dreams can be pretty messed up. Somedays, I sleep only 30 minutes and see content 
                worth 5-6 hours (at least what it feels like), and some days, I sleep for 12 hours 
                and donâ€™t see a dream at all. Though this is rare, I have never had the privilege 
                of sleeping 12 hours continuously, though I may be in bed for that time. <br><br>

                Coming to think of haunted dreams, where dreams are particularly eerie, 
                I donâ€™t have much. When I was a kid, I used to see all kinds of ghost movies 
                and had haunted dreams more often, but now I have not watched them (for 15 years?) 
                for good reasons, and I am devoid of such dreams. <br><br>


                As time passed by, I often had new ideas come into my dreams, and in most cases, 
                they worked like a charm. As if my subconscious is giving me the solution to a 
                particular problem I have been thinking about for days, if not weeks. Though rare, 
                these kinds of dreams are a blessing in disguise. <br><br>

                Precognition is a strange phenomenon. I find it intriguing that the human brain 
                can do much more than we see in general. The continuous input to the brain and 
                its simultaneous processing of it makes it a very powerful future visualizer. 
                If a model can see everything that is happening in the world for a very long time, 
                I feel that it can even predict the future to some extent. In my case, and most of 
                the people with whom I have shared this, the dreams take form in real life within 
                a six-month period. I had more than 70 instances where some part of the dream was 
                replicated in the future, giving it a deja-vu-style phenomenon. This is one of the 
                reasons I took a chance in GATE. Even before preparing for the GATE exam, I knew 
                I would be in one of the best institutes in India; though I didnâ€™t know the exact 
                name and location, after coming here and seeing the places, I can relate exactly 
                what I have seen in my dreams. The same goes for RKMVERI and Xavier. This is a 
                really weird phenomenon, making me think I live in a simulation and have been 
                in a loop for a long time. <br><br>

                I had my first instance of sleeping paralysis in class 4 when I was on the 
                IIT KGP campus. I still remember I was trying to call my mom since I had a 
                swimming class, but I couldnâ€™t even open my mouth. I felt even a touch could
                wake me up, but I had to endure till my brain formed a proper connection with 
                all my muscles. Finally, I woke up on time and went to swimming class which was 
                scheduled for 5:30 p.m. This phenomenon didnâ€™t re-appear until I was in class 11, 
                and I had four instances of it in a month. When discussing with people, most said 
                this happens to them too; it feels like someone is holding their body, like a spirit 
                of some sort. I had it over thirty times now; the last two were vivid. I could 
                analyze what exactly is happening. Firstly I thought it was the body that cannot 
                move in the real world, but I was wrong. It happens when your conscious sense wakes 
                up, and you donâ€™t. This generally happens due to reflexes, protecting your body 
                from subtle temperature/pressure changes in your body. Inputs from the real world 
                make the dream form an environment similar to the real setting in which you sleep. 
                Ultimately, you are in a dream, hearing and seeing things in a dream, which is 
                influenced by inputs from the real world. It was believed that sanyasis could feel 
                the environment in the dhyana state, keeping their eyes closed; it is somewhat similar 
                to that. It might be creepy, but it is what it is. The only way to avoid this is to 
                tell yourself that you will wake up; finally, you want to sleep properly for a long 
                time, so sleep peacefully. <br><br>

                Some people also get dreams which they believe are instances from their past lives 
                which have been etched into their souls. Several Bengali literature terminologies say 
                that these phenomena also occur in real life. I donâ€™t have much experience with them, 
                nor do I get them, though there have been instances where I see a completely different 
                place and later find that these places exist in real life in some way or another. I 
                believe if you think a lot about something, it will get manifested in real life in 
                some way or another. <br><br>

                Let us consider a hypothetical situation of sleep with two parallel worlds. 
                The one that you are in, living and doing your job, and the other a similar 
                one, which only activates after you fall asleep in this world and wake up in 
                the other one. Now, time is relative; it doesnâ€™t have to be exact clock hours;
                even in sleep, you lose track of reality and time. So, which world would you 
                choose if the memories were saved in the dream world? If every time you sleep 
                in this world, it starts right where you ended your dream in that world before 
                entering this one? Wouldnâ€™t you be confused about reality? What if the reality 
                that we live in is a similar phenomenon? Arenâ€™t there too many mysteries in 
                this world that cannot be solved, and we are bound by simulation? 
                We never knowâ€¦. <br><br>
