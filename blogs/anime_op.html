            <h2> From <i>Naruto </i></h2><br>
            <h2>Madara Uchiha</h2><br>

            Madara Uchiha is a GOD. He is the only being who has no weaknesses, hence even the writer didn't 
            know how to kill him. Here is the speech which I truly admire: <br><br>

            <a id="bold_id">

            Wake up to reality.

            Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed world. The longer you live, the more 
            you will realize, that the only things that truly exist in this reality are merely pain, 
            suffering and futility.

            Listen...

            Everywhere you look in this world, wherever there is light, there will always 
            be shadows to be found as well. As long as there is a concept of victors, the vanquished will also exist.
            The selfish intent of wanting to preserve peace, initiates wars. And Hatred is born in order to protect Love.
            There are nexuses, causal relationships that cannot be separated.

            I want to sever the fate of this world.

            A world of only Victors.
            A world of only Peace.
            A world of only Love.
            I will create such a World.

            I am... the Ghost of the Uchiha.

            For truly this reality... is a Hell.

            </a><br><br>

            The fact that he fought the whole shinobi world along with all the tailed beasts single 
            handedly shows the power and determination of this character. He is the founder of the Uchiha 
            Clan, which runs the show. <br><br>

            <br>
            <br>

            My take from this anime is there are no villains and heroes in this world. We admire heroes as kids, 
            but as we grow old, we learn to understand the philosophy of villains. After all, everyone is born 
            with a pure heart. Everyone is controlled and exploited by some other's decision in one or another 
            way throughout life. Even if you get everything in the world, which you desire, you won't be happy. 
            There is nothing as perfectness or utopian world. He who walks alone walks the fastest. How much you grow, 
            there will be someone who surpasses you in everything. There's a saying: Roses are red. Violets are blue. 
            No matter how hard you try, an Asian will be better than you. Someone's life's work might be someone's 
            weekend's work, it all depends. Success is relative. It might thrill someone for achieving something, 
            but other may consider such achievements meaningless, he/she may have such achievements for breakfast. 
            The greatest men are unnoticed. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            Being the best has their own set of consequences, which might not always be good. 
            Ultimately, everyone is cursed by their own destiny and fate, which are unavoidable. Whatever happens will 
            happen eventually, how much hard you try to stop it. Karma is a real thing, and destiny cannot be avoided.
            One who learns to master to control his/her mind wins the world. Happiness, health and peace of mind are the 
            things that a person needs to chase, not money or fame, because everything is temporary. Humans have created 
            this idea of a society in such a way that everyone is bound to live within its norms. Humans have made 
            themselves the only thing that has meaningful existence in this universe, which might not be true. 
            We are specks of solar dust anyway, and our existence is merely a process of manipulating atoms.

            <br><br>

            The power balance in everyone's life remains almost the same. It's extremely unlikely that a person 
            is extremely well in both sports and academics. He/She may be very good in academics but may suffer 
            from disease. It is necessary to find happiness in nothingness. One who has a bad and childhood full 
            of hardships, usually has a good adulthood with minimum effort, since he/she has learnt the way world 
            works, and an unknown power works in support, protecting the balance. The reverse is also true, hence 
            everything in this world is balanced. Getting everything and knowing everything beforehand can make the 
            present very boring.
            
            <br><br>

            Also, as a character, Naruto was very dumb in the beginning. It's not always to set out bias towards 
            the outstanding ones. The real fun is when a guy with average intelligence surpasses everyone just by 
            rigorous training and by the will and determination of never giving up.<br><br>


            <h2>Itachi Uchiha</h2><br>

            He is the prodigy who could have surpassed Madara Uchiha. His sacrifice for the village will 
            be remembered. He thought like a Hokage at the age of 7. <br><br>
            
            Here are some of his quotes: <br><br>

            <a id="bold_id">

            Even the strongest of opponents always has a weakness. Knowledge and awareness are vague, and perhaps 
            better called illusions. People live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true. That's 
            how they define Reality. But what does it mean to be “correct” or “true”? Merely vague concepts… Their 
            Reality may all be a mirage. Can we consider them to simply be living in their own world, shaped by their 
            beliefs?  Everyone lives within their own subjective interpretation. Teachings that do not speak of pain 
            have no meaning, for humankind cannot gain anything in return. I actually don't think something like 
            perfection exists. That is, I think why we are born able to absorb things... and by comparing ourselves
            with something else we can finally head in a good direction. It is not wise to judge others based on your 
            own preconceptions and by their appearances. Those who cannot acknowledge themselves will eventually fail.

            <h2>Uchiha Clan</h2><br>

            To be honest, all the strongest and the prominent members of Uchiha are cool. 
            They possess extraordinary power which only the Senjus can rival. <br><br>

            <br>

            <h2>Akatsuki</h2><br>

            These are probably the coolest villains in the anime history. They are so cool that 
            even two members can destroy a single village. They were mainly assigned to capture 
            the tailed beasts, which probably a whole arsenal of any village will fail to achieve.
            All the members of Akatsuki are at Hokage level and are extremely professional and 
            efficient in completing their tasks in time. <br><br>

            <h2> From <i>Akame ga Kill! </i></h2><br>
            <h2>Esdeath</h2><br>

            Well, I thought I will put Gojo before Esdeath, but it wouldn't be fair. She is the 
            empire's strongest and coldest character. Probably the best female character in the 
            anime world. She brings back memories of someone whom I have seen in real life :) The 
            saddest part of this anime is all the best characters dies at the end, including Esdeath.
            She leads the Jaegars team. <br><br>

            <h2>From <i>Jujutsu Kaisen </i></h2><br>
            <h2>Gojo Satoru</h2><br>

            Overpowered Kakashi, level 1000 boss who is replaying the game just for fun. 
            He is the strongest sorcerer and the strongest character in the jujutsu world. <br><br>

            My man just woke up one day, and started to speak facts. Some of his famous quotes are: <br><br>

            <a id="bold_id">
            Dying to win and risking death to win are completely different. <br>
            When Granted Everything, You Can't Do Anything. <br>
            But no matter how many allies you have around you, when you die, you'll be alone. <br>
            Love Is The Most Twisted Curse Of All. <br>

            <h2>From <i> Chainsaw Man </i></h2><br>
            <h2> Makima aka 'Control Devil' </h2><br>

            Being the charming character, one might think she is saving the humanity, 
            since she is with the good-side, but the truth is she is the real antagonist 
            of the series, and one of my favorite characters. Her powers are unknown and 
            of unimaginable magnitude. <br><br>

            <h2> From <i>Death Note</i> </h2><br>
            <h2>Ryuga Hideki</h2><br>

            Super smart, but dies just because he was friend with his murderer. 
            He is a prodigy and I would recommend Death Note to everyone. 
            Here is his famous saying <br><br>

            <a id="bold_id">
            There are many types of monsters in this world, monsters who will not show themselves and who cause 
            trouble. Monsters who abduct children, monsters who devour dreams, monsters who suck blood, and, 
            monsters who always tell lies. Lying monsters are a real nuisance, they are much more cunning than 
            other monsters. They pose as humans, even though they have no understanding of the human heart. They eat, 
            even though they've never experienced hunger. They study even though they have no interest in academics. 
            They seek friendship even though they do not know how to love. If I were to encounter such a monster, I 
            would likely be eaten by it, because in truth, I am that monster.
            </a> <br><br>

            <h2>From  <i> Classroom of the Elite</i> </h2><br>
            <h2>Kiyotaka Ayanokoji</h2><br>

            “Genius lives only one storey above madness.” This guy was created in the white room 
            (a mysterious organization), where you sacrifice childhood to be an exceptionally 
            talented student of the country. He has displayed tremendous ability in every field 
            he was trained in since childhood, right from studies to sports. To experience how 
            the world works in real life, he has been admitted to a school where he chooses to 
            remain average. 
            
            “It takes great talent and skill to conceal one’s talent and skill.”
            

            He doesn’t have such social skills as other candidates of the class, 
            but the things that he does without them are truly exceptional.
            He is a true genius and stays to remain average, to lie below the radar, 
            where in real life, he is the best student the system has seen. He rarely 
            takes part in the front lines and controls the class from behind.

            <h2> From <i> One-Punch Man</i> </h2><br>
            <h2>Saitama</h2><br>

            This character shows us that for being super strong, one need to work tremendously hard. 
            He worked so hard that all this hair fell off. He probably is the strongest hero, but he 
            stays at the bottom for specific reasons.<br><br>

            <a id="bold_id">
            In exchange for power, maybe I've lost something that is essential to being human. <br>

            <h2>Anos Voldigoad</h2><br>

            Anos tells us that everything depends on the user, not weapon. For example, if one is an expert, 
            he doesn't have to use legendary weapons for doing extra-ordinary damage, they can cause extra-ordinary 
            damage with normal weapons. Similarly, a naïve user cannot cause extra-ordinary damage even if he is given 
            legendary weapons. He being the lord of the devils, and enormous powers, shows substantial charm from episode 1. <br><br>

            <h2> From <i>Tokyo Ghoul </i></h2><br>
            <h2>Rize Kamishiro</h2><br>

            The anime takes its turns. I would not recommend this to anyone except the first and second seasons. 
            She is the source of power for Kaneki Ken, since her Ghoul parts were transplanted to Kaneki Ken, 
            the protagonist of the story. Though Kaneki took her powers to new heights, by training and 
            patiently enduring. <br><br>

            There's no such thing as fate. It's simply a combination of one circumstance and the next. <br>
            There are times when you have to give up on one thing to preserve the other.

            The smart kid that we all wanted to be sometime in our life. I am not sure how long the 
            episode chain will continue, but looks like he will not age yet. He was drugged to a younger 
            form but he had not been able to find his culprits yet.  <br><br>
