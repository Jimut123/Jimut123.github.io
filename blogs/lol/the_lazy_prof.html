This story is from my undergraduate studies. One fine day, 
Prof. P finally completes his syllabus by uncovering some of the topics. <br><br>

<b>Prof. P </b>: So, finally this course is coming to an end, what do you guys want me to do the coming two extra class? <br><br>

<b>Student 1</b>: Sir, let's take a test, this will give us an understanding of our progress. <br><br>

<b>Prof. P </b>: What? Do you think this is a coaching center? No, no, any other guy wants to suggest something? <br><br>

<b>Student 2</b>:Sir, let's revise this topic on Dijkstra algorithm? <br><br>

<b>Prof. P </b>: What? Dijkstra algorithms have been taught pretty well, what were you doing at that time? 
Chatting on your phone? You should have probably studied and attended the class more carefully. Any other suggestions? <br><br>

<b>Student 3</b>: Sir, let's give it a self revision day? <br><br>

<b>Prof. P </b>: Yeah so you can chat on your phone and play games? What will Father say if he comes to visit the class? <br><br>

<b>Murmuring class</b>: What does he want us to tell him? <br><br>

<b>Prof. P </b>: Okay, let's agree to disagree, we will be taking that day off. See you at endsem! bell rings, prof ran away! <br><br>
