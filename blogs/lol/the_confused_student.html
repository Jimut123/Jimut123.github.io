So, <b>Prof. S</b> was asking for submission of assignment, where only 2 students have completed the assignment. <br><br>

<b>Prof. S</b>: Where are the other guys? Only three students came to class today…?? <br><br>

<b>Me (Student 1) </b>: Sir, they are all sick… (probably face) <br><br>

<b>Prof. S</b>: Sick of what? The class ?? <br><br>

<b>Me</b>: Not sure… (confused face) <br><br>

<b>Prof. S</b>: Okay, you three are here, now show me the assignment that I gave the other day… <br><br>

<b>Me</b>: Sir, here it is… <br><br>

<b>Student 2</b>: Sir, here it is… <br><br>

<b>Student 3 (let's call him A</b>): Clueless… <br><br>

<b>Prof. S</b>: <b>A</b>... where is your assignment? <br><br>

<b>A</b>: Sorry sir, forgot to do it… <br><br>

<b>Prof. S</b>: Okay no problem, call <b>Prof. P</b>. <br><br>

<b>A</b>: Sir, <b>Prof. P</b> is completing his daily running routine right now, I might not be able to catch him. Is it very urgent? <br><br>

<b>Prof. S</b>: Yes it is, now go and call <b>Prof. P</b>, I have to talk to him urgently. <br><br>

<b>Student A</b> runs and finally catches up with with <b>Prof. P</b>, telling that <b>Prof. S</b>, wants to talk with him, and needs him urgently.  <br><br>

<b>Prof. P</b> asks <b>A</b> about the job and <b>A</b> is unaware of it, convinces him to come to see <b>Prof. S</b>. <br><br>

<b>Prof. P</b>: Yes <b>Prof. S</b>, what is the matter? You called me? <br><br>

<b>Prof. S</b>: Yes, this guy is creating nuisance in this class, not even completing any one of the assignment. 
Please give him some “bakuni” (scolding) <br><br>

<b>A</b>, is probably thinking, what an era that I live in… This prof called me to dig my own grave. <br><br>

That day, <b>A</b> got a good scolding in front of the whole class, which includes 3 students. Student 1 and 
2 were probably laughing at the back, and gesticulating <b>A</b> so that he laughs too. <br><br>

<b>A</b> was sweating as hell, since laughing in that scenario will be DEATH.<br><br>
