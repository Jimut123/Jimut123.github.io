In our upcoming lecture, we'll delve into 
the fundamentals of PyTorch, with a primary 
emphasis on deep learning and its practical 
applications. Additionally, we intend to 
leverage the comprehensive toolset provided 
by OpenCV. I encourage you to inform me about 
the topics you'd like covered in the recitation, 
as well as your team name and members; please 
note that teams are limited to a maximum of 
two individuals.

Furthermore, I will assign a project that extends 
the concepts covered in the lecture, focusing 
on areas such as 3D segmentation. The mid-semester 
evaluation is scheduled to be flexible, tentatively 
in March, following the conclusion of my own 
mid-semester assessments. The end-of-semester 
assessment is anticipated to take place in May. 
Your active participation and timely communication 
will contribute to a successful and enriching learning 
experience.
