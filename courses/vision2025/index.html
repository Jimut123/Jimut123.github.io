							<p>
								The surge in integrating computer vision algorithms into daily activities has 
								prompted the development of this comprehensive course. Commencing with foundational 
								Python3 programming, the curriculum advances toward the pragmatic implementation 
								of programming concepts using the widely recognized OpenCV library, renowned for 
								its classical computer vision methodologies. Participants will not only 
								explore the intricacies of the PyTorch framework but also attain mastery in 
								designing models tailored explicitly for classification and image segmentation—critical 
								algorithms in both industry and research domains. The course goes beyond theoretical 
								understanding, offering potential hands-on experience in creating a deployable real-world 
								application, effectively showcasing the practical application of acquired skills.
							</p>

							<p>
								This introductory program seamlessly blends theoretical concepts with immersive, 
								hands-on tutorials, making it an ideal choice for individuals eager to delve into 
								the realm of computer vision. The tutorial-driven approach is meticulously 
								designed to cater to those enthusiastic about applying classical and cutting-edge 
								deep learning algorithms to real-world scenarios, thereby enriching their comprehension 
								and practical application skills in the field. For those who have previously taken 
								computer vision courses, there may be some overlap in theory; however, this course 
								distinguishes itself by providing complementary support in terms of programming and 
								application—an invaluable asset widely utilized in the industry for creating real-world 
								applications. PDF of this Webpage can be found [ here ].

							<p>
								We will actively use Google Space for communication and slide sharing. Please find 
								the Google Space here. Please note due to certain restrictions, I cannot put the slides 
								online at the current moment, however they are available in the private Google Space.
