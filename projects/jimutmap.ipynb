    "\n",
    "This manually brute forces [apple-map](https://satellites.pro/#32.916485,62.578125,4). It Then scraps all the tiles (image and road mask pair) as given by the \n",
    "parameters provided by the user. This uses an API-key generated at the time of browsing the map. The api acess-key (which can be found out by selecting one tile from Apple Map, through chrome/firefox by going Developer->Network and then it is this part of the link &accessKey...dark) is valid for a period of 10-15 mins. You need to manually go to [apple-map](https://satellites.pro/#32.916485,62.578125,4), get the API access key by pressing ctrl+shift+E and going to the network area. I tried to reverse engineer this thing but couldn't. First part of the key is time in sec from 1970, but other part is some output of complex function which needs time to decipher. If anyone finds it, let me know, submit a P.R and which may make this API fully automatic.\n",
