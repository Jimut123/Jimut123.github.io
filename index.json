Awate Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2024 Abstract Article BibTeX Abstract: For object segmentation in medical images deep neural networks (DNNs) typically perform poorly on out-of-distribution (OOD) images stemming from the large variability in image-acquisition equipment and protocols across sites. However compared to such variability in the acquired medical images we observe that the variability in the underlying object-segmentation maps is far lower. Thus we propose a novel DNN framework to model this variability in segmentation maps and leverage it to revive poor segmentations produced by existing DNNs on OOD images. Our DNN framework (i) learns the principal modes of variation in a class of segmentation maps (ii) models each segmentation map using a low-dimensional mixture-of-modes latent representation on a simplex (iii) enables sampling-free variational learning and uncertainty estimation and (iv) trains using small in-distribution image sets. When OOD-image segmentations are extremely poor we propose a novel human-in-the-loop method needing minuscule human intervention. Results using 6 publicly-available datasets and 8 existing DNN segmenters show the benefits of our framework in OOD-image object segmentation. Convex Segments for Convex Objects using DNN Boundary Tracing and Graduated Optimization Jimut Bahan Pal and Suyash P. Awate International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2024. Abstract Article BibTeX Abstract: Image segmentation often involves objects of interest that are biologically known to be convex shaped. While typical deep-neural-networks (DNNs) for object segmentation ignore object properties relating to shape, the DNNs that employ shape information fail to enforce hard constraints on shape. We design a brand-new DNN framework that guarantees convexity of the output object-segment by leveraging fundamental geometrical insights into the boundaries of convex-shaped objects. Moreover, we design our framework to build on typical existing DNNs for per-pixel segmentation, while maintaining simplicity in loss-term formulation and maintaining frugality in model size and training time. Results using six publicly available datasets demonstrates that our DNN framework, with little overheads, provides significant benefits in the robust segmentation of convex objects in out-of-distribution images. Advancing instance segmentation and WBC classification in peripheral blood smear through domain adaptation - A study on PBC and the novel RV-PBS datasets Jimut Bahan Pal , Aniket Bhattacharyea, Debasis Banerjee and Tamal Maharaj Expert Systems With Applications. ( 2024 ). Find the Novel RV-PBS dataset here . Abstract Article Slide Code BibTeX Abstract: Automating blood cell counting and detection from smear slides holds significant potential for aiding doctors in disease diagnosis through blood tests. However, existing literature has not adequately addressed using whole slide data in this context. This study introduces the novel RV-PBS dataset, comprising ten distinct peripheral blood smear classes, each featuring multiple multi-class White Blood Cells per slide, specifically designed, for instance segmentation benchmarks. While conventional instance segmentation models like Mask R-CNN exhibit promising results in segmenting medical artifact instances, they face challenges in scenarios with limited samples and class imbalances within the dataset. This challenge prompted us to explore innovative techniques such as domain adaptation using a similar dataset to enhance the classification accuracy of Mask R-CNN, a novel approach in the domain of medical image analysis. Our study has successfully established a comprehensive pipeline capable of segmenting, detecting, and classifying blood samples from slides, striking an optimal balance between computational complexity and accurate classification of medical artifacts. This advancement enables precise cell counting and classification, facilitating doctors in refining their diagnostic analyses. Improving Multi Scale Attention Networks - Bayesian Optimization for Segmenting medical images Jimut Bahan Pal and Dripta Mj The Imaging Science Journal. ( 2023 ) Abstract Article Code BibTeX Abstract: Current deep learning based image segmentation methods are notable for their use of large number of parameters and extensive computational resources in training. There is a persistent need for more efficient flexible systems without compromising on precision. This work proposes a novel model that combines the best of deep learning and probabilistic machine learning to segment a wide variety of medical image datasets with state-of-the-art accuracy and limited resources. The approach benefits from the introduction of new diverse attention modules that serve multiple purposes including capturing of relevant information at different scales. These proposed attention modules are generic and can potentially be used with other architectures to boost performance. In addition, Bayesian optimization is employed to tune multi-scale weight hyperparameters of the model. The architecture combined with one of the proposed novel attention modules and tuned hyperparameters achieves the best results in segmenting ISIC 2017, LUNGS, NERVE, Skin Lesion, and CHEST datasets. Finally, the explainability of the network is analyzed by visualizing the feature map learned from the attention modules. Biomedical image analysis competitions - The state of current participation practice Matthias Eisenmann, Annika Reinke, ... Jimut Bahan Pal ... Lena Maier-Hein arXiv. ( 2022 ) Authors Abstract Article BibTeX Abstract: The number of international benchmarking competitions is steadily increasing in various fields of machine learning (ML) research and practice. This holds especially true for the field of biomedical image analysis, for which dozens of competitions are organized each year. So far, however, little is known about the common practice as well as bottlenecks faced by the community in tackling the research questions posed. To shed light on the status quo of algorithm development for biomedical imaging analysis, we designed an international survey that was issued to all participants of challenges conducted in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) and the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in the year 2021 (n = 80 competitions in total). Besides questions pertaining to general information on the team and the tackled tasks, the survey covered participants’ expertise and working environments, their chosen strategies, as well as algorithm characteristics. A median of 72% challenge participants took part in the survey. According to our results, knowledge exchange was the primary incentive (70%) for participation, while the reception of prize money played only a minor role (16%). While a median of 80 working hours was spent on method development, a large portion of participants stated that they did not have enough time for method development (32%). Surprisingly, only 25% perceived the infrastructure to be a bottleneck. Overall, 94% of all solutions were deep learning-based. Of these, 84% were based on standard architectures. 43% of the respondents reported that the data samples (e.g., images) were too large to be processed at once. This was most commonly addressed by patch-based training (69%), downsampling (37%), and solving 3D analysis tasks as a series of 2D tasks. KSurprisingly, k-fold cross-validation on the training set was performed by only 37% of the participants and only 50% of the participants performed ensembling based on multiple identical models (61%) or heterogeneous models (39%). 48% of the respondents applied postprocessing steps.

Jäger, Annette Kopp-Schneider, Lena Maier-Hein Holistic network for quantifying uncertainties in medical images Jimut Bahan Pal International MICCAI Brainlesion Workshop, BrainLes 2021, Brainlesion, Glioma, Multiple Sclerosis, Stroke and Traumatic Brain Injuries. ( 2022 ) Abstract Article Slide Video Code BibTeX Abstract: Variability in delineation is an inherent property for segmenting medical imagery, when images are annotated by a variety of expert annotators. Previous methods have used adversarial training, Monte-Carlo sampling, and dropouts, which might sometimes produce a wide range of segmentation masks that differ from the styles of mask produced by a set of expert annotators. State-of-the-art method uses multiple U-Nets to capture the individual delineations, but it is computationally demanding. To mitigate this problem, a holistic network containing N-Encoder and N-Decoder is proposed, which could individually model the variability of delineation produced by the expert annotators. This will help to create segmentation masks for different tasks of the same dataset through a single network by learning the common features of multiple Encoders via a common channel and passing those features to Decoder. These create one segmentation mask. All the masks are calculated by using weighted loss at each end of the Decoders that show excellent results for some datasets. Classifying Chest X-Ray COVID-19 images via Transfer Learning Jimut Bahan Pal and Nilayan Paul 2021 Ethics and Explainability for Responsible Data Science (EE-RDS), published in IEEE Xplore. ( 2021 ) Abstract Article Slide Video Code BibTeX Abstract: The internal behavior of Deep Neural Network architectures can be difficult to interpret. Certain architectures achieve impressive feats in a particular dataset while failing to show comparable performance in other datasets. Developing an architecture that performs well on a dataset can be a time-consuming affair and computationally intensive process. This study explains the effect of transfer learning by fine-tuning already available state-of-the-art architectures in different datasets and using them to classify Chest X-Ray images with high accuracy. Using transfer learning helps the model learn problem-specific features in a short period. It further shows that different models perform differently in a particular setting for a dataset. Ablation studies show that a combination of smaller structures that gives an overall better result may not give the best result in the combined model. In addition, the “belief” of the model for selecting a particular class is visualized in this study.",

The afternoons were a sanctuary of simplicity, with gaming sessions from 1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., followed by either swimming classes or engaging in cricket, football, or spontaneous adventure games on the IIT KGP campus. It wasn't until the eighth grade, when we moved to the ISI Kolkata campus, that I began to contemplate the intricate process behind creating these games. My initiation into the world of gaming started in class 1 with Minesweeper and Pinball, which we played tirelessly until we discovered Road Rash—one of my earliest gaming experiences during my KG-1 days at a neighbor's house. The graphics, though basic by today's standards, held a captivating allure with their simplicity, vibrant colors, and a touch of physical realism that drew me in. From flash games offering brief bursts of gameplay to the quaint Java-written mobile games and the expansive world of PC games, my gaming journey spanned various platforms. My desire to commemorate the memories these games bestowed upon me led me to recollect over 90% of the games I've played, arranged chronologically from the early 2000s to 2016. This webpage stands as a tribute to those games that made my childhood extraordinary, as it was a time predominantly spent on either games or anime. Despite growing up, there's an ongoing quest to rediscover the same joy etched in those memories, yet the pursuit has evolved. The thrill that simple games like IGI provided, with modest graphics but a wealth of surprise and challenging levels, is hard to replicate. The transformation of gaming from single-player campaigns to multiplayer experiences has altered the landscape, and as '90s kids, we find it challenging to derive the same enjoyment from ultra-realistic environments—they lack the raw thrill of our earlier experiences, perhaps a testament to our journey into adulthood. 2002 Minesweeper 2002 3D Pinball 2002 Road Rash 2002 Road Rash II 2003 Alien Shooter 2005 Disney's Aladdin 2005 Return to Castle Wolfenstein 2005 Cosmo Bots 2005 David vs Goliath 2005 Delta Force 2 2005 Dungeon Skeleton 2005 Egg Toss 2005 Hangaroo 2005 Half-Life 2005 Midtown Madness 2005 Monster Truck Madness 2 2005 Motocross Madness 2005 NFS II SE 2005 Project I.G.I 2005 Super Mario Bros 2005 GTA: Vice City 2005 Virtua Fighter 2 2005 Virtua Cop 2 2006 Age of Empires 2006 BC Trolley Dash 2006 Kaun Banega Crorepati 2006 Max Payne 2006 POP: Warrior Within 2006 GTA: Vice City (Replay) 2007 Ghost Recon 2 2008 Pocket Tanks 2012 Air Strike 2 2012 Candy Crush Saga 2012 Counter-Strike 2 2012 Angry Birds 2012 Hot Racing 2 2012 The House of the Dead 2012 Diamond Rush 2012 Fruit Ninja 2012 NFS: Most Wanted 2012 Shark Attack 2014 Blur Racing 2014 Far Cry 3 2014 Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault 2014 Midtown Madness 2 2014 Bounce 2014 Subway Surfers 2014 Moto GP 2 2015 Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag 2015 Call of Duty 2015 Call of Duty 2 2015 Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare 2015 COD: Advanced Warfare 2015 COD: Black Ops 2015 COD: Black Ops II 2015 COD: Infinite Warfare 2015 COD: Modern Warfare 2 2015 COD: Modern Warfare 3 2015 COD: World at War 2015 Grand Theft Auto V 2015 Asphalt 8 2015 Green Farm 2015 Lara Croft Go 2015 Temple Run 2015 Contra 2015 Project I.G.I 2 2015 GTA: San Andreas 2015 Sniper Elite 3 2016 Clash of Clans 2018 PUBG Mobile From my extensive list, standout favorites include IGI, Midtown Madness, Vice City, and the Call of Duty series.

        "content": "In the budding stages of their relationship, the girl discovered the boy's diary, where he had poured out his innermost thoughts: \"In my youth, I had an affinity for all things new—books, toys, friends. However, as time advanced, my preferences evolved. I came to appreciate the nostalgic scent of old books over fresh ones. I transformed discarded toys from my basement into new creations and endeavored to mend the lives of those misguided by unfortunate events. Making new friends became a rarity, reserved for those emitting a similar aura. The act of reviving and crafting from unused or broken parts brought me immense joy. It felt like breathing life into neglected entities that craved purpose. Fixing people, though messy at times, seemed worthwhile. Repairing replaceable items, like a broken umbrella, by hand reflected my genuine care for my belongings. To me, everything possessed a life of its own. Perhaps that's why my possessions stop working once I pass them on to someone else. I sense life in things, devoid of consciousness, and believe they too experience love. However, in matters of human connection, especially romantic involvement, broken individuals gravitate toward me. I've never been someone's first love, and once fixed, people tend to leave. Mending a broken heart parallels repairing a cracked glass vase—it may seem restored, but the fracture remains. Fixing is transient in this existence, and a pure soul, once cracked, cannot be held together indefinitely. Is this why I've remained single for five years? People depart, yet inanimate objects endure. Unlike living beings, things don't betray you. Their value often goes unnoticed until desperation strikes. I question whether my attraction to simplicity will hinder my ability to relish life's extravagances. The few things I genuinely love—my research work, functional code, and family—have become my pillars. Activities I once enjoyed, like playing computer games, have lost their allure. If this pattern persists, I may end up alone after losing my close ones. Finding individuals who share my sentiments and emotional values is rare, and I cherish those connections. While being poor is one thing, wealth without meaningful connections feels isolating, as if no one truly understands or cares.\" Suddenly, the boy entered and found the girl in tears. He expressed, moved by the narrative, \"Huh? I copied this from some forgotten website.\" Concerned, the girl responded, \"I was worried about you; I thought it was about you.\" The boy chuckled, \"Nopes, why would it be me? Just a complete loser soul… lol.\" The girl smiled, bid farewell, and on the doorstep lay the meticulously stitched umbrella.",

        "content": "The last time I did something serious in natural language processing was during my days at RKMVERI, probably for selecting a project for my ML-1 course, back in 2020. During that time, I thought language generation was a cool thing, and people back then were using all sorts of RNNs, LSTMs, Bidirectional LSTMs, and whatnot to generate/summarize texts and even for sentence completion tasks. I didn't have a fascination for NLP tasks since the ideas were not natural to me. If I had taken a linguistics course, I would have taken a keen interest in it. The only interesting thing that came to my mind was story generation. I didn't have the requisite knowledge to make this idea into reality, since I was starting to read ML back at that time, but I was fascinated by the way the human mind compresses data and spits out interesting, and sometimes randomly connected stories during REM sleep. I thought, if I have some 4-5 keywords and I would generate some nearest token to connect those keywords, and have 3-4 passes to interpolate more interesting ideas inside it, I can perhaps come up with a story generation mechanism. Later, when I discussed this thing with my ML-1 mentor, he said that many people at the Ivy League are trying to do this, so he didn't recommend I invest time in something that will take more time than the completion of the course project, since I could afford about 3-4 months for a course project. So, I worked on a simple task, i.e., song generation. After working for 2-3 days, collecting some Keras code from Kaggle and piecing together a pipeline to do so, after repeated failed attempts, I was able to train a bidirectional LSTM to complete a line of a song, and generate about 1024 characters more. The moment I completed the training and gave some randomly rhyming words for completion, it generated complete unrelated rhyming garbage, with a lot of slang. I still remember giving it a prompt to complete a song. I started with: “I was a little boy” and the output it generated was: “I was a little boy, she was a little bitch ...” followed by those slurs repeated again and again. I thought this was doing something which I didn't expect it to do, like, this is generating curse word songs, and I wouldn't be able to present this to my mentor, so I gave up on this project and started working on image segmentation in the medical domain. Later I found out that the dataset I used for training had a lot of curse words in it, and the model just learned to mimic the dataset. I was a bit disappointed, but I thought that this is how things work in ML, and I should have been more careful while selecting the dataset, but it was too late, and I have already invested a lot of time in medical image segmentation This was the last time I touched NLP code seriously, and after that, now, I am thinking of catching up with all those things that I have ditched back then. After the invention of LLMs for chatting (like ChatGPT, etc) and after hearing Geoffrey Hinton's and Illya Stuskever's discussions, I thought LLMs might think the way humans think, that they might be a bit conscious, but after working with transformers for a while, I think that is complete nonsense. The idea of even thinking that something like language might someday wake up consciousness in a machine feels disgusting. These models, which we call LLMs, are essentially Ogre, eating and compressing a lot of data into their latent manifold, and spitting out interpolated, sometimes weird, unrelated mispredicted stuff (also called hallucination in modern day) for a query. This works in most of the usual and mundane tasks at hand, but I don't think that you can have something like mind/consciousness/reasoning in machines. They might simulate it, but not like humans, who actually reason to find solutions to complex problems. Actually, I don't even think that reasoning/consciousness can be represented in some mathematical representations. They are just something that can't be done algorithmically (which is essentially some form of mathematical construct). I completely disagree with the idea that I thought in my previous blog , but this again can be debated endlessly. So, with all these background yapping, let's dive into the pytorch code, where we talk about the transformers paper, implement a code for translation and break down some essential components.",
